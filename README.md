This work compares 2 methods based on the LNS-FFPA search algorithm to solve the DARP in minicp.
One method uses Insertion Sequence Variables <minicp/minicpISV/src/main/java/minicp/examples/DARP_LNSFFPA_Seqvar>, the other <minicp/minicpISV/src/main/java/minicp/examples/DARP_RK> doesn't.
minicp/minicpISV/src/main/java/minicp/examples/DARPtest.java contains scripts to compare the 2 methods.

Some ISV constraints have been implemented in minicp/minicpISV/src/main/java/minicp/engine/constraints/: First, Last, Precedence, TransitionTimes.
Unit tests for these contraints can be found in minicp/minicpISV/src/test/java/minicp/engine/constraints/
